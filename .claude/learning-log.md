# AutoIngest Agent Learning Log

This file records reusable lessons from completed AutoIngest work.

Purpose:
- Capture recurring mistakes.
- Capture durable implementation rules.
- Capture validation checks.
- Capture architecture decisions that should influence future agent behavior.

Rules:
- This file may contain proposed lessons.
- Not every lesson should be promoted to agent files.
- Temporary one-off notes should stay out.
- Do not paste screenshots or long chat history.
- Keep entries concise and reusable.

### 2026-05-02 — Release v0.8.1 Preparation

Task type:
- Feature Status / Release / Documentation

What happened:
- v0.8.0 was committed and tagged without adding an entry to `docs/history.md`. The gap was discovered during v0.8.1 release prep when `docs/history.md` still showed v0.7.4-dev as the latest entry.
- v0.8.1 was the first release where `docs/history.md` was explicitly updated as part of the release commit.

Reusable lesson:
- `docs/history.md` is the canonical release history file for AutoIngest. Every tagged release must have a matching entry there. There is no separate CHANGELOG. If a prior release is missing its entry, note the gap rather than backfill it with invented content.

Common failure mode:
- Committing and tagging a release without appending to `docs/history.md`, leaving the version history permanently inconsistent.

Preferred pattern:
- During every release: read `docs/history.md`, append a new `## vX.Y.Z` section following the established format (Changes / System Impact / Notes), then include the doc update in the release commit.

Promote to agents:
- release-docs-writer.md

Status:
- Promoted
